# Developer Guide

## Introduction

Drawing from [https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-community-guidelines](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-community-guidelines), this is the first cut of the contributions/developer guide.  I'll list out the guidelines we'd follow as a community:

1. be kind
2. write your contributions on `features/xxxx` and do PRs to `develop`
3. PRs are applied as squashed merges from `feature` -> `develop` -> `master`
4. admins do `develop` -> `master` merges as part of a release
4. semantic versioning
5. all people are welcome here as long as they obey the rules
