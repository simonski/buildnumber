# Developer Guide

## Introduction

Drawing from [https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-community-guidelines](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-community-guidelines), this is the first cut of the contributions/developer guide.  I'll list out the guidelines we'd follow as a community:

1. be kind
2. all people are welcome here as long as they obey the rules

## Git

When committing, please use the following git flow 

1. choose an unassigned issue to work on
2. assign yourself to it
3. work in a branch off `develop` called `features/n-xxx` where the feature branch name is `features/4-git-docs`, for example
4. commit freely to the feature branch
5. PR to `develop` only working complete code
